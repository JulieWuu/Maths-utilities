The two folders contain Python implementation of:
- sorting and packing algorithms in `C1_sorting&packing`
- matrix manipulations in `C2_graphbasics`
based on A-level Further **Decision Maths** course, created while I was doing the course. <br><br>

Some maths utilities created when trying to solve **maths puzzles** (e.g. the ones in Euler Project) around 2023-2024.

Main projects:
- simple hangman game `hang_man`
- Euler Project Problem `maximum path sum`

*`max_path_file.txt` and `0067_triangle.txt` are the two versions of the "maximum path sum" puzzle*
