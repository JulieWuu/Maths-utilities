Some maths utilities created when trying to solve maths puzzles (e.g. the ones in Euler Project) around 2023-2024.

Main projects:
- simple hangman game `hang_man`
- Euler Project Problem `maximum path sum`

*`max_path_file.txt` and `0067_triangle.txt` are the two versions of the "maximum path sum" puzzle*
